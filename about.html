            <p>
                Colorado has some absolutely stunning golf course.  The mountains provide a nice backdrop to make for a scenic round.  Although the weather here doesn't allow for play year round, its a wonderful summer passtime.

            <p>
                I have been playing hockey since I was about 6 years old.  It turned into a family affair and we spent most of our weekends at tournaments or games.  I still enjoy playing currently and I try to do so as often as time allows.

            <p>
                Attending live shows is one of my favorite ways to spend my free time. Red Rocks ampitheater is one of the most amazing places to see a show.
